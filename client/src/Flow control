App.js to either Logged in(current app.js which will become adminapp.js, app.js(normal users page) or login page)
From login page if user is admin(go to adminApp.js if not go to normal app.js file)
In current app.js will turn into adminapp.js file which will house the addTool, delete tool, update tool as well as lift broken/missing markers
A new app.js file will be made which will be very similar to admin without the add/delete tool buttons as well as update tools. 
Users will be able to checkOut tools, flag them broken or missing as well as comments on the tool
When an item is flagged broken/missing, it sends and email to the correct person to advise them of the flagged item 
Admin will have to lift the broken and flagged markers
